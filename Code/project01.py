# PROJECT 01 SOLUTIONS

# Part a)-------------------------
# Ordinary Least Square on the Franke function
# with resampling

# This is just Ridge with lambda = 0
# Need to find variance of beta, compute MSE

x, y = CreateSampleData(100, 0.01)


# Part b)-------------------------
# Ridge Regression on the Franke function
# with resampling


# Part c)-------------------------
# Lasso Regression on the Franke function
# with resampling

# Discuss which method is best


# Part d)-------------------------
# Introducing real data

# Potentially download own data from website
# Just get the data represented in variebles
# and maybe split it up if it's too much



# Part e)-------------------------
# OLS, Ridge and Lasso regression with resampling

# Basicly repeat of a-c just with real data
